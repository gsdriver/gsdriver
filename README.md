I'm the CTO and co-founder of [LegUp](https://www.legup.care), a startup dedicated to helping working parents find and enroll in quality child care throughout their child's life. A father of two, I've seen first-hand the difficulty in securing care, getting into after-school programs or summer camps, or having a backup for unexpected emergencies. Prior to LegUp, I was CTO of the CarRentals.com brand in Expedia, leading a global technology team building the stack for the brand.

I've always enjoyed learning and coding, and did several side projects, many in the area of voice with a series of published Alexa skills. More recently, I've been coding in React, Express, and Postgres as I build out LegUp's platform. You won't find the code for our platform here - but you can browse my voice skills and other side projects.

As a lifelong learner myself, I also enjoy helping others learn. If my code helps you, please let me know - I genuinely love to hear that! And if you see a bug or want to share some learnings with me after viewing my code, drop me a note - I'm all ears!
